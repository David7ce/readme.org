* Title
** Subtitle
This a test in Org Mode, it is similar to markdown but with different syntaxis.
~example of a code~.

/cursive/ =/cursive/=

** Lists
Example of lists
1. The attack of the Rohirrim
2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
   + this was already my favorite scene in the book
   + I really like Miranda Otto.
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
   - on DVD only
   - He makes a really funny face when it happens.
But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
Important actors in this film are:
- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
- Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
